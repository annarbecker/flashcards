    <div id="moduloInfo">
        <p>The modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called modulus). Given two positive numbers, a (the dividend) and n (the divisor), a modulo n (abbreviated as a mod n) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of a by n. Example: 5 % 3;

      <ol>
        <li>Variables should begin with a letter (they can also begin with $ or _ but these symbols are not advisable...stick with the letters!).</li>
        <li>Variables are case sensitive (myNumber is a different variable than myNUMBER).</li>
        <li>Use clear, descriptive names that describe the value being stored like myNumber.<li>
        <li>Avoid shorthand or initials that would be difficult for another person (or yourself later) to understand. For example: var x = 45 doesn't tell us what the value is. Is 45 an age, a distance, a size, a time? And something like var mn = 45 isn't much better. mn may clearly mean myNumber to you at first but later you or another may not have those details.</li>
